This is a project in Java which uses RMI for conecting two calculators as clients. You write one number on each calculator and select the operation you want
and when you press the = button you will get the result in base of the operation. For example if you write 15 on one calculator, 3 on the other and select + on the
first calculator and press = button you will get 18 on the first calculator as result.
